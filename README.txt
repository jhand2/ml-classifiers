Machine Learning Classifiers
----------------------------

This project implements various machine learning topics/algorithms and attempts
to provde some transparency into how they are working and what kind of accuracy
these algorithms achieve.

Directories contain the following:

    data: Actual data records as well as python files to model these data
          sets and allow operations on them.

    models: Python files for each of the actual classifiers

    metrics: Python files for running tests and evaluation metrics on
             classifiers
